Vim-magma is a vim plugin for the [Magma] computer algebra system. Vim-magma supports syntax highlighting and indentation for Magma.

## Installation

These instructions assume you use a bundler (e.g. [Pathogen]). In this case you should do following:

```sh
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/Garogolun/vim-magma.git
```

[Pathogen]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

## Built-ins

The [list](magma-builtins) of built-ins used is generated by

```sh
$ magmadoc=/path/to/magma/doc/html
$ cat $magmadoc/*.htm | sed -nr "s/^.*NAME = \"([A-Z][[:alnum:]]*)\".*$/\1/p" | sort > magma-builtins
```

That trick is stolen from [magma-mode], see [this file].

You may find this list also useful for [rlwrap]. Use it with `magma -f magma-builtins` or install to `~/.magma_completions`.
